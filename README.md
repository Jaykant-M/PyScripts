# Data Visualisation Using Python
"A picture is worth a thousand words".
It becomes even more worthwhile when trying to explain the insight obtained from the analysis of increasingly large datasets.


The main goal of this project is to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. 
I've tried to demostrate my learning through this project for presenting data visually by leveraging several data visualization libraries in Python such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy.
